            <p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Applications with a strong interest in software development and web technologies. While I'm still in the learning phase and haven't completed major projects yet, I'm actively building my skills through online courses, personal experiments, and hands-on practice.</p>
            <p>I'm eager to apply what I learn, collaborate with others, and grow into a capable developer. Every day is an opportunity to improve and take on new challenges.</p>
